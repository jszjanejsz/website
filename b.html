 <p>Breaking Music Festival is an electronic music festival project tailored for NetEase's electro music brand FEVER.
    The location of the festival is the Lusheng Square in the Thousand Household Miao Village in Guizhou Province. We took the ancient legend of the Miao minority, "Mother Butterfly", as the entry point, trying to find the connection between electro music and traditional culture, and combined the silver ornaments in Miao costumes with the envelope line after the visualization of electronic music to complete our concept and visual content for this project.
